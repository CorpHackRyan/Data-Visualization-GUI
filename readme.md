    roconnor-Sprint2 (for Project 1)
    Authored by: Ryan O'Connor

roconnor-Sprint2 is a program that collects data from a given URL with specific field parameters in it. It will then take that data it has collected and export it to a text file.

    INSTALL DIRECTIONS
    o Do not forget to have a secrets.py in the same directory and add your API key to it
    
    o Your secrets.py file should look like:  
      api_key = "xxx"

      Where xxx is your API key for data.gov


    MISSING FROM PROJECT: 
    o Variability for field parameters to allow any field name for future requests
